      <header><h2>Airbrushing is secretly easy</h2></header>
      <p> An airbrush is a small, air-operated tool that sprays various media, most often paint but also ink and dye, and foundation by a process of nebulization. Spray painting developed from the airbrush and is considered to employ a type of airbrush.</p>
  <p>An airbrush works by passing a stream of fast moving (compressed) air through a venturi, which creates a local reduction in air pressure (suction) that allows paint to be pulled from an interconnected reservoir at normal atmospheric pressure. The high velocity of the air atomizes the paint into very tiny droplets as it blows past a very fine paint-metering component. The paint is carried onto paper or other surfaces. The operator controls the amount of paint using a variable trigger which opens more or less a very fine tapered needle that is the control element of the paint-metering component. An extremely fine degree of atomization is what allows an artist to create such smooth blending effects using the airbrush.
  </p>
  <p>The technique allows for the blending of two or more colors in a seamless way, with one color slowly becoming another color. Freehand airbrushed images, without the aid of stencils or friskets, have a floating quality, with softly defined edges between colors, and between foreground and background colors. A skilled airbrush artist can produce paintings of photographic realism or can simulate almost any painting medium. Painting at this skill level involves supplementary tools, such as masks and friskets, and very careful planning.
  </p>

  <p>Some airbrushes use pressures as low as 20 psi (1.38 bar) while others use pressures in the region of 30-35 psi (2-2.4 bar). Larger "spray guns" as used for automobile spray-painting need 100 psi (6.8 bar) or more to adequately atomize a thicker paint using less solvent. They are capable of delivering a heavier coating more rapidly over a wide area. Even with small artist airbrushes using acrylic paint, artists must be careful not to breathe in the atomized paint, which floats in the air for minutes and can go deep into the lungs. With commercial spray guns for automobiles, it is vital that the painter have a clean air source to breathe, because automotive paint is far more harmful to the lungs than acrylic. Certain spray guns, called High-Volume Low-Pressure (HVLP) spray guns, are designed to deliver the same high volumes of paint without requiring such high pressures.

    <section class="main-section" id="The_Trigger">
  <header>    <h2>The Trigger</h2>
              </header>
      <h3>Single Action vs. Double Action</h3>
      <p>The simplest airbrushes work with a single-action mechanism where the depression of the trigger actuates air flow through the airbrush. The airbrush's color flow and spray pattern are adjusted separately from the trigger action. This is done through an adjustment of the airbrush's needle placement within its paint tip, by the turning of the paint tip on an external mix airbrush (Badger 350 or Paasche Model H are good examples of single-action external mix airbrushes) or the turning of a needle setting dial on an internal mix airbrush (Badger 200 or Iwata SAR are good examples of single-action internal mix airbrushes). The color volume and spray pattern are maintained at a fixed level until the airbrush user re-adjust the setting. Single-action airbrushes are simpler to use and generally less expensive, but they present limitations in applications in which the user wishes to do something more artistic than simply apply a good, uniform coat of color.</p>

  <p> Dual-action or double-action airbrushes enable the simultaneous adjustment of both air and color at the trigger, by allowing the user to actuate air by depressing the trigger and simultaneously adjust color by sliding the trigger back and forth.[5] This ability to adjust color flow while spraying the airbrush, coupled with the users adjustment of distance from the sprayed surface allows for the variation of fine to wide lines without stopping to re-adjust the spray pattern as is necessary with a single-action airbrush. This allows for greater spray control and enables a wider variety of artistic effects.  </p>

  <p>This type of airbrush requires some amount of practice to become proficient in triggering technique and control, but it offers greater artistic versatility to the artists once the triggering technique is learned. Dual-action airbrushes (Badger Patriot 105, Paasche VL, Iwata CM-C are all good examples of dual-action airbrushes) are of a more sophisticated design model than single-action airbrushes, which tends to make them the more expensive of the two.</p>

  <p>
  Usually the trigger is a very robust mechanical component and any trigger issues can be further divided into two categories:

  <h5>Body Issues</h5>
  <p>Body issues come from contact or friction between the trigger mechanism and different components, and are usually a consequence of paint buildup in the trigger stem, the trigger body hole, or any components that are close to a spring loaded valve mechanism. For these kind of issues, usually a good cleaning is a very effective solution.</p>
  <h5>Valve Issues</h5>
  <p>Valve issues come from either paint buildup in the valve mechanism (Due to poor sealing or old damaged seals) or natural wear and tear of the valve mechanism. This becomes evident when the return of the spring valve becomes weak or even stuck. Usually a good cleaning of the valve is enough and replacing the valve spring can be necessary.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="The_Nozzle">
      <header>
        <h2>The Nozzle</h2>
      </header>
      <p>The nozzle is the part that causes most issues and since its typically very frail, can cause a lot of headache. Cleaning the nozzle should be the first thing to do before painting, the last thing you do after painting, and a procedure done with extreme care. Probing or scraping  are dangerous tools to use, a good soak in solvent with a gentle use of a dental brush should be enough for most use cases.</p>
      <ul>The usual issues with the nozzle are:
        <li>Obstructed tip.</li>
        <li>Clogged nozzle.</li>
        <li>Offset needle.</li>
        <li>Deformed or bent nozzle tip.</li>
        <li>Fissures in the nozzle (Split nozzle).</li>
        <li>Nozzle seal issues.</li>
        <li>Poor nozzle/needle contact.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These issues generally manifest by spray pattern issues, such as uneven application, an oval or uneven spray pattern, paint splattering, or uneven pressure. This might cause staining, spider webbing and further obstructions, wich are by default even more troublesome to fix. So keeping a clean nozzle and checking your nozzle for obstructions often saves a lot of trouble eventually. Keep in mind that sometimes an obstructed nozzle allows work to be done, and the lower pressure or smaller spray footprint might become confortable, but working with obstructions in the nozzle makes them cure and harden and makes further issues more troublesome. So try and learn proper pressure control and paint thinning and keep your nozzle clean as a whistle.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>How to fix a faulty nozzle</h3>
    <p>Sadly, there's little to do. If it's bent or deformed you might try correcting it with heat and/or force, but it's near impossible to achieve a perfect circle  whilst preventing the tip from collapsing. Using a needle as a guide usually ends up in fissures. This piece is very delicate and should be treated with great care, for the only fix avaliable usually is replacement. Also, replacing nozzles is usually quite costly (Specially if you use Harder and Steenbeck).</p>
    <p>If the nozzle has fissures people have had some success by using a very precise application of super glue or employing a bit of bee's wax to try and seal the gap, but generally even if you have some success, the spray pattern is not really completely fixed and you will end up replacing the nozzle. So for a quick hack in a pinch is ok, but usually just find a replacement part.</p>
    <p>Depending on the type of nozzle bee's wax or some teflon tape can help if you have sealing issues. If the needle is offset usually the culprit is deeper in the body, keep in mind some of the cheaper brands and models have unfixable offset needles.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Feed_Type">
  <header>
        <h2>Feed Type</h2>
  </header>
      <p>
  Paint can be fed by gravity from a paint reservoir sitting atop the airbrush (called gravity feed) or siphoned from a reservoir mounted below (bottom feed) or on the side (side feed). Each feed type carries unique advantages. Gravity feed instruments require less air pressure for suction as the gravity pulls the paint into the mixing chamber. Typically instruments with the finest mist atomization and detail requirements use this method since less air pressure allows for finer control paint flow and less overspray. Side- and bottom-feed instruments allow the artist to see over the top, with the former sometimes offering left-handed and right-handed options to suit the artist. A bottom feed airbrush typically holds a larger capacity of paint than the other types, and is often preferable for larger scale work such as automotive applications and tee-shirt design.

  <h2>Mix Point</h2>
  With an internal mix airbrush the paint and air mix inside the airbrush (in the tip) creating a finer atomized "mist" of paint. With external mix the air and paint exit the airbrush before mixing with each other, which creates a larger coarser atomization pattern. External mix airbrushes are cheaper and more suited for covering larger areas with more viscous paints or varnishes.</p>

  <h2>Airbrush Technique</h2>
  <p>Airbrush technique is the freehand manipulation of the airbrush, medium, air pressure and distance from the surface being sprayed in order to produce a certain predictable result on a consistent basis with or without shields or stencils. Airbrush technique will differ with the type of airbrush being used (single-action or dual/double-action).</p>
  <p>Double-action airbrush technique involves depressing the trigger on the top of the airbrush with the index finger to release air only, and drawing it back gradually to the paint release threshold. The most important procedural dynamic is to always begin with air only and end with air only. By observing this rule, precise control of paint volume and line width and character can be achieved. The single most important airbrush stroke consistently utilized by professionals is the dagger stroke. This describes a stroke which begins wide and ends as a narrow line, created by starting with the brush far from the support and moving it evenly closer as the line is drawn.</p>
  <p>Single-action airbrush technique derives its name from the fact that only one action is required for operation. The single action of depressing the trigger releases a fixed ratio of paint to air. Achieving different line widths requires either changing the tip and nozzle combination or else adjusting the spray volume manually between spray width changes. The most important aspect of proper single-action airbrush technique is to keep the hand moving before the trigger is depressed and after the trigger is released. This avoids the "bar bell" line.</p>

    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
  </header>
  <h3> (From <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/donsairbrushtips/">Don's Airbrush Tips</a> )</h3>

  <h4>No air comes out</h4>
  <code>
  Obvious question:  Did you disconnect the air line from the brush and check that your compressor or other air source is supplying plenty of air?
  </code>
  <code>Some trigger mechanisms are tricky to install.  Are you sure yours is in right?  Can you feel the air valve spring when you press the trigger?</code>

  <code>If you remove the head assembly, there is a little hole in the main body where air should come out when you press the trigger.  See the photo on the right for its location on the 155. If air does come out, then the problem is probably something clogging the head assembly.  Hopefully, there is no dried paint blocking this little hole.  If there is, you may have to soak the body in something to soften it so it can be blown out.  Be sure to remove the air valve assembly before doing this.</code>

  <code>If air doesn't come out, then the only thing left is the air valve assembly.  Be very careful if you dismantle it.  There are some very small parts and a tiny spring.  See the photo on the right of a Badger air valve assembly.  There is probably a little rubber O-ring that could be damaged.  If you’ve gotten lacquer thinner on it, it may have swollen enough to jam.  It may return to normal if you let it air out for a few days.  If not, you may have to replace it.  Make sure all the parts are clean and work smoothly.  Many advise applying airbrush lube.  I don’t, but I guess it couldn’t hurt.
  </code>

  <h4>Sticky Trigger</h4>

  <code>For some reason I seem to see this problem most often from Iwata owners.  They usually write that they clean the air valve assembly, and it works OK for a short time and then begins sticking again. Sometimes they mention finding paint residue in the valve. If there is paint, where did it come from?  The only possible source is through the needle bearing. Either they are pulling the needle out when there is still paint in the brush, or the needle bearing is leaking.  In some airbrushes there is an adjustment on the needle bearing that might stop a leak.  If not, or if that doesn't work, the bearing needs to be replaced.
  </code>

  <code>In some airbrushes, the trigger pin passes through a rubber o-ring.  It may need a tiny bit of lubrication.  Most users and manufacturers recommend regular airbrush lube.
  </code>

  <h4>Bubbles in the paint cup</h4>
  <code>This seems to be the most common problem people have with their airbrush.  It shows up regularly on the forums I monitor.  First, make sure the head assembly isn't loose.  Snug it up, but don't over-tighten or you might strip the threads.  If that doesn't do it, then consider this.  The only way bubbles can happen is if there is a leakage from the air path to the paint path.  Now look closely at your airbrush.  If you have the type with a floating nozzle (aka tip), there is no gasket between it and the main body of the brush.  In the photo on the right, the arrows point to the surfaces where the parts mate.  Paint flows inside the nozzle and air flows on the outside.  The only thing keeping them apart is the metal to metal seal.  This seal is only good if both the nozzle body and the hole it fits into are perfectly round and dirt free.  One way to see if there is a problem here is to rub a little bees wax on this part of the nozzle and see if the bubbles go away.  If they do, you may need a new nozzle.
  </code>

  <code>If your airbrush has a screw-in nozzle like the one on the right, you may have a gasket, possibly made of Teflon, to seal off the nozzle to body joint.  You didn’t lose the gasket did you?  Over time, these gaskets can be compressed enough that they leak.  This is an easy fix.  Just replace the gasket.  I've also found that a little lip balm, like Chapstick, on the threads can solve the problem.
  </code>

  <code>If you have a tiny screw-in nozzle like the Iwata HP-CR on the right, you may need some sealant like bees wax or lip balm on the threads.  Be extremely careful not to over tighten it.
  </code>
  <code>The only other place that air can get into the paint path is at the tip of the nozzle, like when you back flush by holding your finger or a paper towel against it.  A tiny crack in the end of the tip can cause bubbles.  Check it closely with a magnifying glass.  I’ve read that paint build-up can occur here and also cause bubbles.  I’ve never seen this, but it's worth checking for.
  </code>

  <code>In order to create a vacuum to pull paint out of the brush, the nozzle has to protrude just a tiny bit past the front of the spray regulator.  If it doesn't, you can get pressure instead of a vacuum here and air will blow back into the cup or bottle.  This can be a problem in airbrushes with rubber O-rings in the head assembly.
  </code>


  <h4>Intermittent spraying
  </h4>

  <code>This can be caused by the same things listed above for bubbles in the cup.  For a siphon fed brush, it can also be caused by a worn needle bearing or seal.  See my page on replacing the needle bearing for this. Make sure it isn’t a paint problem.
  </code>

  <h4>Continuous Paint
  </h4>

  <code>A common problem is that paint will spray as soon as you press the trigger for air, even before pulling back the trigger.  This happens because of an imperfect seal between the needle and nozzle.  It sometimes doesn't show up at lower air pressures.  It can be caused by a small particle of dirt or dried paint in the nozzle, or a needle or nozzle that is not perfectly round.  At low pressure, there is not enough vacuum to overcome the paint viscosity and pull it through the small opening.  When the pressure is increased, so does the vacuum and paint is expelled.
  </code>

  <code>Sometimes, it can be fixed by rotating the needle in the nozzle with slight pressure.  Some people apply a little pressure to the back of the needle when they tighten the needle chuck.  But, you have to be careful not to damage the nozzle.  Soaking the nozzle in a solvent that dissolves dry paint may also help.
  </code>

  <code>Another possibility is that the needle seal is too tight for the trigger return spring to fully seat the needle.  You may be able to adjust the trigger tension or the needle seal.  You should feel a little drag when you install the needle, but it shouldn't take much force.
  </code>
